# Trigger Prompts Submodule Plan

## Scope

Add a reload-gated world setting for a GM-authoritative combat trigger system.
Each trigger is a separately defined module loaded through a registry. The
initial release provides possible opportunity-attack and enemy-miss prompts.

## Trigger architecture

- A shared trigger-definition contract supplies the trigger ID, label,
  enablement requirements, default ability resolver, and event evaluation.
- Non-OA triggers are opt-in per actor. OA is globally active while the master
  setting is enabled, but its response ability remains configurable per actor.
- Each trigger can use any actor inventory item. A blank selection means use
  that trigger's hard-coded default ability lookup.
- Future trigger candidates and reusable predicate directions are recorded in
  `TODO.md`.

## Actor configuration

- Add an actor/prototype-sheet header control available to actors' owners and
  GMs.
- Store configuration on the Actor; do not add token-specific overrides.
- The dialog contains a row per trigger. Toggleable triggers receive a checkbox
  and every trigger receives an item selector.

## Evaluation and delivery

- A single active GM evaluates only events in a started active combat, whose
  involved tokens are combatants in that combat.
- Relationships use token disposition.
- Create one hidden prompt per eligible actor. Every active non-GM owner and
  every active GM can see it. NPC prompts consequently reach GMs only.
- The prompt gives the selected ability and a `No` control. The ability posts
  its normal item card using normal chat visibility; it is not rolled.
- Accepting marks the prompt used and disables controls. `No` deletes it.
- Existing prompts remain after combat ends.

## Initial detection rules

- Possible OA: when a hostile combatant changes position beginning adjacent to
  an eligible actor, emit one prompt for that actor, even if the mover ends
  adjacent. Each eligible actor receives its own prompt.
- Enemy miss: derive each defender's result from DnD4e's structured standard
  attack workflow and target-defense values (including natural 1/20 when
  available). A miss against one target still qualifies even if other targets
  were hit.
- Active Defense reports its resolved enemy-miss result through the same
  internal combat-event contract.
- Ignore manually authored chat cards and third-party attack lookalikes in this
  initial release.

## Error handling

- If the configured item is missing and the default resolver finds no item,
  suppress the prompt and issue a concise GM-facing warning.
