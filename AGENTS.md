# Banter 4e Modifications

Foundry VTT v13 module for DnD4e homebrew automation: simplified conditions and skills, optional NPC-vs-player active defense, and BEACON-inspired backgrounds/titles. It targets the DnD4e system's legacy [`0.7.14` source](https://github.com/EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta/tree/0.7.14); do not assume current upstream APIs or behavior apply without checking this tag.

## Layout

- `scripts/main.js`: module entry point; registers settings, hooks, and SocketLib handlers.
- `scripts/modules/player-defense/`: intercepts NPC attack rolls and adds player defense buttons to chat. Its `socket-helper.js` performs GM-only SocketLib chat-message updates.
- `scripts/modules/dnd4e-system-customizations/`: mutates DnD4e status effects and skill definitions during `init`.
- `scripts/shared/`: shared logging and module setting/flag keys. `module.json` is the manifest.
- `scripts/tools/`: development-only damage-calculation utilities.

## Architecture

- `module.json` loads the entry-point ES modules; `main.js` imports feature classes and attaches them through Foundry lifecycle hooks.
- At `init`, `Dnd4eSystemCustomizations` changes the DnD4e configuration. At `i18nInit`, the active-defense setting is registered and, when enabled, its event hooks are attached. At `ready`, shared helpers are exposed on `game`.
- `PlayerDefense` is event-driven: it records an NPC attack from `dnd4e.rollAttack`, replaces the matching attack chat message with defense controls, then resolves a clicked defense roll.
- Clients render and click chat controls, but SocketLib routes message mutations to a GM through `SocketHelper`; mutable module state is stored on `game.PlayerDefense` and `game.SocketHelper`.

## Working conventions

- Use ES modules, Foundry hooks, and the DnD4e system API; preserve v12 compatibility unless intentionally upgrading it.
- Keep the active-defense flow GM-authoritative for chat-message edits via SocketLib, and preserve ownership checks before a player rolls.
- Use braced, multiline `if` blocks. Document methods with JSDoc, using multiline JSDoc blocks whenever practical.
- Changes that affect initial hooks or the manifest should be tested by reloading Foundry and checking the browser console. There is no automated test or build setup.
- Changelog entries are release summaries, not per-change notes. Since the last version, list new features and changes to existing behavior in short, concise bullets that support future regression review.
- Do not enable or alter the commented-out BEACON hooks without explicitly intending to ship that feature.
- Track project TODOs as appropriately labeled GitHub Issues rather than local TODO files.

## Naming and method style

- Name methods for the domain operation or state transition they perform: `captureNpcAttack`, `createPendingDefense`, and `resolveDefenseAttempt` communicate more than incidental implementation steps. Reserve `on...` for Foundry hook handlers.
- Use verbs that match the method's role: `find...` for lookups, `is...`/`has...`/`can...` for predicates, `create...` for new documents or workflow state, and `resolve...` for committed outcomes. Keep private implementation helpers private with `#`.
- Split an event workflow at meaningful transitions—capture, evaluate, create, claim, resolve, and finalize—so each method has one orchestration responsibility. Keep calculations, rendering, and compatibility reads in focused helpers when they represent a named concept.
- Avoid shallow pass-through helpers. A method earns its name when it hides a decision, a Foundry-system quirk, a state transition, or repeated implementation detail from its caller.
- When data crosses a hook, socket, or persisted flag seam, document its shape and authority in JSDoc. Prefer names such as `attackContext`, `defenseAttempt`, and `promptState` over generic `data` or `context` when the role is known.
