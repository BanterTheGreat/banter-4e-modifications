Just a module to make changes to the DND4e System in foundry, implementing some homebrew which is better aided by automation.

- Backgrounds & Title as in the BEACON TTRPG
- Players roll for Defense instead of Enemies for Offense
- Removes a lot of Status Effects which I feel just bloat up the menu
